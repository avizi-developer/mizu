# Mizu
Mizu is a free and open-source (FOSS) spaced-repetition flashcard application based on FSRS. Mizu is the forever-free and completely cross-platform successor to Anki. 

Mizu is intended to be a feature-complete replacement of the beloved Anki application. This application was created in light of Anki's ownership transfer to a for-profit organization. 

Mizu is designed from the ground-up to be fully cross-platform: it can run on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile (iPhone, Android) with a first-class plugin system that is available everywhere.

## Features
- Free and open-source forever
- Study spaced repetition flashcards with built-in FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler)

- Card browser for bulk editing, tagging, etc.
- Built-in, free, local text-to-speech (TTS) generation
- Robust, thoroughly documented plugin system available for both desktop and mobile equivalently
- Sync/backup freedom - local-first, folder-based collection that allows you to use your own sync system/backup:
  - You can simply use a local folder `mizu` on your computer/phone
  - You can put the `mizu` folder in your cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive), which can be shared across your devices
  - Or use Mizu's cloud sync which can be shared across your devices, similar to Obsidian
- Available for desktop (Windows. macOS, Linux) and mobile (iPhone, Android) with **100% feature parity, including plugins**
- Proudly built without AI vibecoding slop

## Philosophy
Simpictly and clarity of use that minimizes learning curve.

Thorough documentation and a clear plugin API design to foster a strong community of developers.

Full cross-platform compatibility between desktop and mobile. If a feature is not available for all platforms, it should not be published. Users should be able to use Mizu from their computer and their smartphone equivalently.

Knowledge is a human right.
